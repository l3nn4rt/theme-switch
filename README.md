# theme-switch

Simple script for rotating predefined combinations of gtk, icon and shell
themes within the Gnome.

I use it with <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> and find it very convenient in the
transition from day to night.

## tl;dr

This script was meant to be a prototype for my first gtk extension. But, as
soon as I made it, I realized that many similar extensions already existed. So
it is yet a prototype and, just like many prototypes, it became the thing (i.e.
the extension) it was supposed to inspire. However, this may still be followed
by a real extension in the future...

### hypotetical features

- menu to add/remove/order theme combos
- combo activation based on time/screen brightness/network profile
- proof of P=NP
